# Light Speed IO (LSIO)
The ultimate ambition is to enable folks to efficiently load and process large, multi-dimensional data as fast as modern hardware will allow.

For now, this repo is just a place for me to tinker with ideas. This code won't do anything vaguely useful for months!

Under the hood, my hope is that `light-speed-io` will use [`io_uring`](https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf) on Linux for local files, and use [`object_store`](https://lib.rs/crates/object_store) for all other data I/O.

My first use-case for light-speed-io is to help to speed up reading [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/). After that, I'm interested in helping to create fast readers for "native" geospatial file formats like GRIB2 and EUMETSAT native files. And, even further than that, I'm interested in efficient & fast _computation_ on [out-of-core](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Out-of-core), chunked, labelled, multi-dimensional data.

See [`planned_design.md`](planned_design.md) for more info.

## Project structure

Light Speed IO is organised as a [Cargo workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html) with multiple ([small](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/structural/small-crates.html)) crates. The crates are organised in a [flat crate structure](https://matklad.github.io/2021/08/22/large-rust-workspaces.html). The flat crate structure is used by projects such as [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), and [rust-analyser](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer).

LSIO crates names use snake_case, following in the footsteps of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html) and [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/tree/main/crates). (The choice of snake_case versus hyphens is, as far as I can tell, entirely arbitrary: [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/tree/main/crates) and [rust-analyser](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/tree/master/crates) both use hyphens. I just prefer the look of underscores!)
