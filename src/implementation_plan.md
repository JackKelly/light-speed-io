- [ ] Implement `io_uring_local`
  - [ ] Flat crate structure
  - [ ] I'm leaning towards doing all this in one go:
      - [ ] Use `enum IoOperation`
      - [ ] Strip out the `object_store` and `tokio` stuff
      - [ ] Start with all byte ranges being `unchanged`. Then optimise.
  - [ ] Use Rayon for multiple io_uring worker threads
- [ ] Implement `object_store_bridge`
- [ ] Benchmark `io_uring_local` vs `object_store_bridge`
